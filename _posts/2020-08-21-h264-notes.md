Video Coding Layer (VCL) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34037635/video-coding-layer-what-exactly-is-vcl-and-what-are-its-functions

VCL understanding is required if more attention needed at decoding syntax. NAL provides one layer of protection around VCL. VCL contains compressed video data in terms of slice. One video frame can be split into one or more slices. Slice contains one or more Macro blocks (16x16 pixel block) in compressed form, following the standard syntax.
